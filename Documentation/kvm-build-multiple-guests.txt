Introduction
============
Building a system with QEMU/KVM host and guest components typically
requires multiple build configurations and copying files before deploying
on a target.  By leveraging the OE/Yocto build system we are able to
to create a system with QEMU/KVM host/guest components in place in a
single build.

WRLinux also provides hooks to add a pre existing guest
kernel/rootfs combination into the host's rootfs
image. In this way, a non WRLinux guest kernel/rootfs can be added to
a WRLinux host and used by qemu.

The following document demonstrates how to configure
and build a system with a KVM host containing guest kernels and
rootfs images as part of the host's rootfs image.

Some Terminology
================
* "host kernel" refers to the linux-windriver kernel that will run on
  the target board.

* "guest kernel" refers to additional kernels intended to be used as
  KVM guests, e.g.  used when running qemu.

Multi Kernel Build
==================
At configure time, in addition to the usual configure options, you can
(1) trigger a build of multiple guest kernels or (2) use an existing
kernel and rootfs as kvm guest images.

1.  --enable-kvm-multi-guest-build=<colon sep. list of guests to build>
    --with-layer=wr-kvm-compile-guest-kernels

The guests to build are defined by the names of scc files in
wr-kernel/recipes-kernel/linux/configs (no .scc suffix).
Example: "x86-kvm-guest" is the key word
	$ ls configs/
		x86-kvm-guest1-standard.scc
		x86-kvm-guest1.scc
		x86-kvm-guest1.cfg

	--enable-kvm-multi-guest-build=x86-kvm-guest1
	--with-layer=wr-kvm-compile-guest-kernels

These configure flags will trigger a build of the guest kernel(s) in
addition to the host kernel.  The guest kernel(s) will use the kernel
features and configuration defined in the scc files.  Note the file:
		x86-kvm-guest1-standard.scc

Typically, the system is configured with
		--enable-kernel=standard

The "standard" keyword is required by the tools.  If you pass in
"x86-kvm-guest1", the tools will append the currently configured
kernel type (e.g. "-standard") to the name when looking for the correct .scc
file.

You can request a build of more than one guest kernel at configure
time, by providing a colon separated list if key words, e.g."
	--enable-kvm-multi-guest-build=x86-kvm-guest1:x86-kvm-guest2

In this case, there must be a set of configuration files in the
configs directory as follows:
		x86-kvm-guest2-standard.scc
		x86-kvm-guest2.scc
		x86-kvm-guest2.cfg
(See Note #3 below)

The number of kernels to be built is equal to the number of members in
the ":" separated list passed in by
	--enable-kvm-multi-guest-build=<guest1:guest2:guestN>

After the host kernel is built, the guest kernels will be built.  The
ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND ensures that the resulting guest kernels
are copied to the host's rootfs.

Here is an example configure command:
	configure --enable-rootfs=glibc_small --enable-kernel=standard \
	--with-template=feature/kvm --enable-board=x86-64-kvm-guest \
	--with-layer=wr-kvm-compile-guest-kernels \
	--enable-kvm-multi-guest-build=x86-kvm-guest1
This configure line will generate a glibc small rootfs with the
standard kernel, using the kvm feature set for the board x86-64-kvm-guest.
In addition, the compile-guest-kernels "layer" specification will be
used, and it will enable a build of one guest kernel.  The guest
kernel will be built with the specific details defined in
wr-kernel/recipes-kernel/linux/configs/x86-kvm-guest1.scc.

2. Use guest kernel and rootfs from another build or distribution:
	--with-kvm-guest-kernel=<ABS path to kernel .bin file>
	--with-kvm-guest-img=<ABS path to rootfs image/initramfs>
	--with-layer=wr-kvm-binary-guest-images

These flags tell the build to copy an existing kernel and rootfs image
onto the hosts' rootfs.  The kernel/rootfs combo can be part of another
build or non WRLinux build.

See configure --help for details.

Notes
=====
1. The configs directory is used only if the build is configured with:
	--enable-kvm-multi-guest-build
2. If --enable-kvm-multi-guest-build is used, local.conf will contain
MULTI_KVM_GUEST_TRIGGER = "1" and this triggers the
linux-windriver_*.bb file to include the kvm-guest-kernel.inc.  If it
is not present, guest multi build will not take place.
3. The details of the scc file are beyond the scope of this document.
scc files follow the WRLinux BSP/Yocto format. Please see the example
scc files in wr-kernel/recipes-kernel/linux/configs.
